Aim: Create a personal website that can serve as a professioal portfolio and an area for me to store my projects.
  - Homepage
  - Resume download (maybe interactive web version?)
  - Blog?
  - Contact me
  
Technologies I want to use:
  - HTML, JavaScript, C#
  - Bootstrap 5
  - .NET Razor framework
  - Database?
  
Appearance: I want it to feel like a website that no one else would make - incorporating my interests and hobbies.
  - Interactive iPod for the website navigation
  - 3D printer that prints some content (text?)
  - Gallery of my film photos with link to 35mm Insta
  - Look for ways to incorporate tennis, chess
